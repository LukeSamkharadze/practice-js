# Task 3

Write a `searchWord` function to find a word within a string. Count found word(s)

Also add type checks and throw an error if params are not strings

```javascript
searchWord('The quick brown fox', 'fox'); // "'fox' was found 1 times."
searchWord('aa, bb, cc, dd, aa', 'aa'); // "'aa' was found 2 times."
```
